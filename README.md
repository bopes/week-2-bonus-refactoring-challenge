# Refactoring

Ignore bonus.md for now -- that's a bonus release for when/if you've finished all other challenges.

In this challenge, you'll need to use parent class(es), inheritance relationship(s), and/or modules to clean up repetition in code.

Your tests currently pass. When you're finished with any given improvement to the code, they should still pass. Do not change the tests.

# Release 0

What do all three classes have in common? DRY it up.

Make sure the tests still pass. (You should be running tests after every change)

# Release 1

What do the Teacher and ApprenticeTeacher classes have in common? DRY it up.

Make sure the tests still pass.

## Continue
* Make sure you have committed your work
* Go to the [Main Readme](../README.md) and review the rest of the assessment
